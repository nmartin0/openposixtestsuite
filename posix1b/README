This library contains implementation of some functions defined
in POSIX.1b standard, which are not present in Linux: 
clock, realtime timers, semaphores, shared memory and message
queues. Timers are emulated using BSD interval timers API:
setitimer() and getitimer(). Semaphore, shared memory and
message queues are emulated using standard System V IPC. 

Total list of emulated functions:

	timer_create
	timer_settimer
	timer_gettime
	timer_getoverrun
	timer_delete

	clock_gettime
	clock_settime
	clock_getres

	shm_open
	shm_unlink

	sem_init
	sem_open
	sem_post
	sem_getvalue
	sem_wait
	sem_trywait
	sem_unlink
	sem_close
	sem_destroy

	mq_open
	mq_close
	mq_unlink
	mq_notify
	mq_send
	mq_receive
	mq_getattr
	mq_setattr

Restrictions:

1) Delivery of timer signals is done by SIGALRM handler event if other
   signal is requested. The handler of requested signal will be called by
   SIGALRM handler with siginfo_t argument (which is not passed in Linux).
   Functions using SIGALRM such as sleep() and alarm() can interfer with 
   raltime timers and stop them by replacing SIGALRM handler.

2) Notification about message receiving is emulated by writing in shared
   memory identifier of process intersted in signal and number of the signal.
   So process sending a message will check this shared variable and 
   send signal to the process by kill(). siginfo_t argument is not available 
   in signal handlers in this case. 

3) timer_getoverrun function is replaced with a stub.
